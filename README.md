## Limitations
- Requires Unity3d 4,
- Source files don't include videos,
- All references to AV Pro Media plugin used to play video files were commented,
- ZigFu trial version is included.

## How to run the app
- Open Scenes/Main scene,
- If you have a Kinect connect it and make sure that it works,
- If you use Kinect for Xbox360 make sure that "Near Mode" and "Track Skeleton In Near Mode" in $/Kinect/Zig/Settings/Kinnect SDKSpecific are not selected,
- Press right arrow to switch slides,
- Uncheck "Show Debug" in $/Kinect/Kinect Depth Grabber to turn live kinect feed off.

This very project is an example of what we were talking about at Unite. It evolved fast, its lifetime was very short, last code changes are ugly. The purpose of releasing this presentation open source is that we hope someone might find it interesting, inspirational or can learn something new from the code. If you wanted to see an ideal app with well-structured code following numerous GoF patterns look elsewhere.

If you have any questions or can't run the demo feel free to ask.
